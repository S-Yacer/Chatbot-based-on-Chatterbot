# Chatbot Project

This project implements a simple chatbot using the ChatterBot library in Python.

## Getting Started

To use the chatbot, you'll need to have Python and the ChatterBot library installed on your computer. You can install ChatterBot using pip:
```
pip install chatterbot
```

Once you have the required dependencies installed, you can start the chatbot by running the following command:
```
python chatbot.py
```

This will start the chatbot, and you can interact with it by entering text into the terminal. The chatbot will respond based on the training data provided by ChatterBot.

## About the Dataset

ChatterBot comes with a built-in corpus of conversational data, which includes thousands of pre-existing conversations in a variety of languages. In this project, we've trained the chatbot using the English corpus data provided by ChatterBot.
